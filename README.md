## Tasks
In this project, our team has developed a book search system based on user requests. 
The service takes a user's description of the book as input and returns a specified number of suitable options. 
In addition to book search, we can offer a system that will find the desired dish and a link to its recipe.
In this case, the user only needs to enter an approximate description of the characteristics and ingredients.
We have implemented a mechanism for analyzing and comparing textual descriptions of dishes, 
which allows for effectively finding alternatives and variations of desired dishes. 
The work represents an innovative approach to searching for culinary recipes and can be useful for both professional chefs and culinary enthusiasts.
